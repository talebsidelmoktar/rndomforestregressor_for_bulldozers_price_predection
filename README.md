# Bulldozer Price Prediction
## Overview
This project aims to predict the auction prices of bulldozers using machine learning techniques. The model is built using a Random Forest Regressor, which is a powerful ensemble method known for its accuracy and robustness. The dataset used for training and evaluation is sourced from auction sales of bulldozers, containing various features such as equipment type, usage hours, and sale dates.

## Features
Random Forest Regressor: Utilizes the Random Forest algorithm for regression to predict the auction prices.
Data Preprocessing: Includes handling missing values, feature engineering, and encoding categorical variables.
Model Evaluation: Assesses the performance of the model using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Visualization: Provides visual insights into the data and model predictions.
## Dataset
The dataset contains historical auction prices for bulldozers, including the following features:

SalesID: Unique identifier for the sale
MachineID: Unique identifier for the machine
ModelID: Identifier for the model of the bulldozer
Usage Hours: Number of hours the bulldozer has been used
SaleDate: Date of the auction
MachineAge: Age of the machine at the time of sale
SalePrice: Price at which the bulldozer was sold (target variable)
## Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
